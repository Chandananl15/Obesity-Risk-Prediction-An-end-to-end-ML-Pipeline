This project predicts individual obesity risk using personal lifestyle, physical, and medical information via a strong end-to-end machine learning pipeline involving data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, and deployment phases. The system exploits several classification techniques to determine risk individuals and may be incorporated in health apps to make early intervention and personalized advice.
